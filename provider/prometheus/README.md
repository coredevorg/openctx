# Prometheus context provider for OpenCodeGraph

This is a context provider for [OpenCodeGraph](https://opencodegraph.org) that lets you hover over a Prometheus metric's registration in your code to see what it's doing in prod and to click through to the live metrics on [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), [Grafana](https://grafana.com/), or another
metrics viewer.

Visit the [OpenCodeGraph playground](https://opencodegraph.org/playground) for a live example.

## Usage

Add the following to your settings in any OpenCodeGraph client:

```json
"opencodegraph.providers": {
    // ...other providers...
    "https://opencodegraph.org/npm/@opencodegraph/provider-prometheus": {
        "metricRegistrationPatterns": [
            {
                "path": "**/*.go",
                "pattern": "prometheus\\.(?:Summary|Histogram)Opts{\\s*Name:\\s*\"([^\"]+)",
                "urlTemplate": "https://prometheus.example.com/graph?g0.expr=$1&g0.tab=0&g0.stacked=1"
            },
            {
                "path": "**/*.[tj]s",
                "pattern": "new promClient\\.(?:Summary|Histogram)\\({\\s*name: '([^']+)",
                "urlTemplate": "https://prometheus.example.com/graph?g0.expr=$1&g0.tab=0&g0.stacked=1"
            }
        ]
    }
},
```

Customize these metric registration patterns to match how your codebase registers Prometheus metrics.

See "[Configuration](#configuration)" for more.

Tips:

- If you're using VS Code, you can put the snippet above in `.vscode/settings.json` in the repository or workspace root to configure per-repository links.
- Play around with the Prometheus provider in realtime on the [OpenCodeGraph playground](https://opencodegraph.org/playground).

## Configuration

<!-- Keep in sync with index.ts -->

```typescript
/** Settings for the Prometheus OpenCodeGraph provider. */
export interface Settings {
  /**
   * Patterns that match metric registrations.
   */
  metricRegistrationPatterns?: MetricRegistrationPattern[]
}

interface MetricRegistrationPattern {
  /**
   * Glob pattern matching the file URIs in which to search for this pattern.
   */
  path: string

  /**
   * Regexp pattern whose first capture group matches the metric name.
   *
   * @example `prometheus\\.HistogramOpts{\s*Name:\s*"([^"]+)`
   * @example `new promClient\\.Histogram\\({\\s*name: '([^']+)`
   */
  pattern: string

  /**
   * The URL to view matching metrics on Prometheus, Grafana, or another metrics viewer, with $1
   * replaced by the metric name.
   *
   * @example https://prometheus.demo.do.prometheus.io/graph?g0.expr=$1&g0.tab=0
   * @example https://grafana.example.com/explore?left=%5B%22now-6h%22,%22now%22,%22Prometheus%22,%7B%22expr%22:%22$1%22%7D%5D
   */
  urlTemplate: string
}
```
